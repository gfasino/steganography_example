# steganography_example

here you will find an implementation of a steganography algorithm as shown on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)

to view an image use:
```
./view_ste_img out.png
```
to create an image use:
```
./create_ste_img base_img.jpg encr_img.jpg
```
(the output will be saved in out.png)

This software is wrote in C++ and use OpenCV lib 
```
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
```

I do NOT own the copyright of the images used as example.
